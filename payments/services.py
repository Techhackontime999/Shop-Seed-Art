"""Shared payment logic: idempotent capture, webhook verification, gateway refunds.

Both the browser callback and the Razorpay webhook funnel through

``finalize_payment`` is the *only* place an order is marked paid, and it
serialises on the payment + order rows with ``select_for_update`` so a payment
can never be captured against an order that was cancelled concurrently.
