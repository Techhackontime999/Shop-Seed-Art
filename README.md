[![Build](https://github.com/Techhackontime999/An-Ecommerce-Site/actions/workflows/django.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Techhackontime999/An-Ecommerce-Site/actions/workflows/django.yml)

A full-featured, production-ready e-commerce platform built on **Django 5.2**.
Shop-Seed is a complete marketplace: a multi-currency, multi-language storefront
with a seller marketplace, Razorpay payments (cards / UPI / netbanking) plus
cash-on-delivery, logistics with shipment tracking, coupons and deals, a blog,
moderated reviews, newsletter double opt-in, and a durable background job queue
for emails, fulfilment and refunds.

It ships with a one-click **Render blueprint**, a **Heroku-style Procfile**, a
full test suite (407 tests) and a GitHub Actions CI pipeline that runs on
Python 3.12 and 3.13.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.12** or **3.13**
- `pip` and `virtualenv`/`venv`
- (Optional) PostgreSQL if you want to develop against prod-like DB

### Linux / macOS

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Techhackontime999/An-Ecommerce-Site.git
cd An-Ecommerce-Site

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env          # review & adjust values
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py create_default_groups   # customers / sellers / admins
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

Open http://localhost:8000 — the admin is at http://localhost:8000/admin/.

### Windows

```bat
git clone https://github.com/Techhackontime999/An-Ecommerce-Site.git
cd An-Ecommerce-Site

python -m venv siteenv
siteenv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

copy .env.example .env
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py create_default_groups
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

There is also an interactive installer, `windows_installation.bat`, which performs
the venv/deps/migrations/superuser steps for you.

> **Windows + WSL:** the repository's `env/` directory is a Linux (WSL) virtual
> environment and will not run on a native Windows Python. Create a fresh venv
> as shown above, or activate it from inside WSL (`source env/bin/activate`,
> `start_wsl.sh`).

### Environment Variables

All configuration is read from the environment, with `.env` auto-loaded in
`config/settings/local.py` / `production.py`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
and edit it. The most important variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default (dev) |
|---|---|---|
| `DJANGO_ENV` | `local` or `production` — selects settings module | `local` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Django secret key | insecure dev default |
| `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Fernet key for encrypted courier credentials (**required in prod**) | dev default |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL URL (prod); leave empty for SQLite | empty |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` | Razorpay API keys | test placeholders |
| `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signing secret (**required in prod**) | empty |
| `ADMIN_URL` | Obfuscated admin mount path (prod) | `admin/` |
| `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` | S3 bucket for persistent media (recommended prod) | empty |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Error tracking DSN (optional) | empty |
| `EMAIL_HOST*` | SMTP settings; dev falls back to console email | — |

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the complete, commented reference.

### Demo Data

Populate the store with realistic demo data (products, variants, categories,
deals, coupons, orders, reviews, blog posts, news, subscribers):

```sh
python manage.py seed_all --preset medium
# presets: tiny | small | medium | large | full
# individual flags: --users --products --orders --reviews --posts --news ...
```

Seed demo users:
- `admin` / `admin123` (superuser + verified seller)
- `priya.sharma` / `test123` and other customers
- `fashion_hub` / `test123` and other sellers

---

## Running Tests

```sh
python manage.py test                 # full suite (407 tests)
python manage.py test order          # one app
python manage.py test order.tests.test_services.OrderViewTests.test_cancel_refunds_captured_payment   # one test
```

The same checks run in CI (`.github/workflows/django.yml`) on Python 3.12 and
3.13: `manage.py check`, `makemigrations --check --dry-run`, then the full test
suite.

---

## Deployment

### Render (one-click)

The repository includes a [Render Blueprint](./render.yaml) that provisions
everything needed:

- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Web service** (gunicorn, 2 workers) — health check on `/healthz`
- **Background worker** draining the async job queue (`run_worker`)
- **Cron jobs**: refund reconciliation (every 10 min), job re-arming (every 5 min),
  tracking sync (every 30 min), exchange-rate refresh (every 12 h)

To deploy:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Go to **https://dashboard.render.com/blueprints** → **New Blueprint** → connect the repo.
3. Render auto-detects `render.yaml`. Fill in the `sync: false` values when prompted:
   `SECRET_KEY`, `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`,
   `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and the `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_*` variables.
4. Migrations, the cache table and the superuser are created automatically in the
   pre-deploy phase (`setup.sh`).

> **Plans:** the free tier covers **one web service + one PostgreSQL** database.
> The background worker and cron jobs require a paid plan (Starter and above).
> On a purely free deployment, disable the `worker` and `cron` services — the
> web app still works, but transactional emails, fulfilment and refund retries
> will not drain until a worker runs.

### Heroku / generic platforms

A `Procfile` is provided:

```
release: bash setup.sh
web: gunicorn config.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers=2 --access-logfile=-
worker: python manage.py run_worker --poll 5 --limit 25
```

Set the same environment variables as for Render (minus the Render-specific ones)
and add the cron commands via your platform's scheduler.

### Production environment variables

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DJANGO_ENV` | ✅ | `production` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | ✅ | unique per deployment |
| `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | ✅ | `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | e.g. Render/Supabase PostgreSQL |
| `SITE_URL` | ✅ | your canonical domain, e.g. `https://www.yourstore.com` — used in emails, invoices, payment links, tracking, SEO previews |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | recommended | comma-separated hosts; defaults to `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` |
| `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | recommended | comma-separated origins; same as hosts for HTTPS |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` | ✅ | Razorpay live keys |
| `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | ✅ | set in the Razorpay dashboard, must match |
| `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME/EMAIL/PASSWORD` | optional | auto-creates/updates the superuser on first deploy |
| `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` (+ access key/secret/region) | recommended | persistent media; without it uploads are lost on redeploy |
| `ADMIN_URL` | recommended | random segment, e.g. `x7k2-admin/` |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | optional | error tracking |
| `REDIS_URL` | optional | Redis cache + sessions; otherwise DatabaseCache |

**Branding.** Your store name, tagline, logo letter, support email, copyright
holder and contact email are all editable at runtime — no code changes needed —
under **Platform Studio → Brand & Identity** in the admin. `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`
(preset `Shop-Seed <no-reply@shop-seed.com>`) is overridable via env for a
custom sender. Every Shop-Seed default (name, logo, emails, demo data) can be
replaced to present the platform as your own storefront.

## Production Operations

### Async worker (DB-backed job queue)

Transactional emails, fulfilment runs and gateway refunds are enqueued as durable
`jobs.Job` rows instead of blocking the checkout/webhook request path. A worker
drains them with crash-safe leases, exponential backoff and attempt caps:

```sh
python manage.py run_worker --poll 5 --limit 25      # long-lived worker
python manage.py run_worker --once --limit 200       # cron-friendly batch
```

Handlers are idempotent (at-least-once delivery). Jobs that exhaust
`JOB_MAX_ATTEMPTS` are marked `dead` and are reviewable in the admin. A
`reconcile_jobs` run re-arms crashed/stuck jobs even if no worker was alive.

### Scheduled jobs (cron)

- **Tracking sync** — polls courier APIs for in-flight shipments:

  ```sh
  python manage.py sync_tracking_status --limit 100 --min-age-hours 1
  ```

- **Exchange rates** — refresh the cached live FX rates (default every 12 h):

  ```sh
  python manage.py update_currency_rates
  ```

### Refund reconciliation

Auto-refunds (cancellation, insufficient stock, capture-after-cancel) are tried
inline and, on any gateway failure, enqueued as a durable `refund_payment` job.
`reconcile_refunds` sweeps every payment where the gateway took money but it
hasn't been returned yet:

```sh
python manage.py reconcile_refunds --dry-run   # preview first
```

### Media storage (S3)

Render's disk is ephemeral — uploads are lost on every redeploy. Set
`AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and
`AWS_S3_REGION_NAME` to serve media from S3. Protected folders
(`protected/`, `seller_documents/`) are never served from the public media URL —
they require the authenticated `accounts:seller_document` view (enforce the same
rule in your S3 bucket policy).

### Monitoring (Sentry)

Set `SENTRY_DSN` to enable error tracking. Optional: `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`,
`SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`, and `GIT_SHA`/`RENDER_GIT_COMMIT` for release tags.

## Security

- HTTPS-only production settings (HSTS preload, secure cookies) behind a proxy
- Content-Security-Policy and Permissions-Policy headers via a custom middleware
- Stored-XSS protection: rich text is sanitized on save
- Field-level encryption (Fernet) for courier API credentials
- Obfuscated admin path (`ADMIN_URL`), rate-limited auth endpoints
- Upload validation (MIME/size limits), oversized-body rejection
- Guest order access via signed, expiring tokens; protected KYC media is never public
- Payment webhooks/callbacks verified by HMAC; captures are idempotent and serialized

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for how to report a vulnerability.
